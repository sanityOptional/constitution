# **RIT Esports Elections**

RIT Esports is a respectable organization, and as such has democratic
elections to fill various leadership positions.

1.  **Executive Board Candidacy Requirements**

    1.  Any member of RIT Esports may run for any Executive Board
        position so long as they have had a prior titled role in RIT
        Esports. This includes being a Player, Manager, Mentor,
        Moderator, Chair, or member of the Executive Board.

    2.  Members may only run for a role if they can fill it for at
        least 1 semester

    3.  A candidate may run for an Executive Board position if they
        will be on co-op for one of the semesters of their term, but
        must disclose this information, and if the co-op is local. In
        the event that the candidate in question is elected and they
        cannot attend in person meetings and otherwise fulfill their
        duties during that semester, a Temporary Executive Board
        Member may be appointed or elected, as the newly elected
        Executive Board sees fit.

2.  **Elections Committee -** The Elections Committee is formed each
    year in the interest of smoothly operating the Executive Board
    elections process. The Elections Committee must consist of at
    least three members and no more than five.

    1.  Any member of RIT Esports may participate in the committee,
        but if more than 5 people wish to join, those who have
        previously been on the committee get precedence, up to a limit
        of 3. In any event, both the precedent spots and regular spots
        are on a first come, first served basis.

    2.  A member of the Elections Committee may not run for the
        Executive Board. If a member would like to do so, they must
        leave the Elections Committee before planning for the
        respective election has begun

    3.  Members of the committee are to remain impartial when
        operating any part of an election under all circumstances.
        Though they may support or oppose any candidate of an election
        - publicly or privately - any actions done to alter or
        artificially determine the outcome of the election will result
        in removal from the committee and a ban from ever
        participating in the committee again.

    4.  Although it is expected that RIT Esports’ Executive Board will
        try to assist in the running of elections, any major decisions
        will be made by the committee as to limit the involvement and
        bias of the Executive Board. Furthermore, no member of the
        Executive Board will be allowed to be on the Elections
        Committee.

    5.  Committee members may not reveal information on who any person
        or group voted for. Overall statistics and results will be
        released, but nothing which could allow a person to figure out
        who an individual voted for.

    6.  Committee members must be helpful whenever possible in
        answering questions and clearing discrepancies regarding the
        elections and the election process.

    7.  The committee will internally elect a committee member as a
        representative. This representative will be given temporary
        announcement posting privileges, and will be responsible for
        posting and maintaining all announcements regarding the
        election.

    8.  Committee members are responsible for maintaining the
        Elections Committee Resources document that contains templates
        for the election forms and committee reflections on prior
        elections.

3.  **Executive Board Elections -** Elections will be held yearly in
    the third to last week of the Spring semester. The elections will then be
    followed by a month-long transition period where the incumbent
    Executive Board members help the newly elected Executive Board
    members learn their responsibilities and how to do their jobs,
    with full turnover happening at the end of the Spring semester.
    Impromptu elections may also be held as needed to fill vacant
    Executive Board positions. In each annual election, all Executive
    Board spots will be up for election. Incumbents must run again to
    be reelected. An announcement will be made by the Elections
    Committee representative internally to the club at the beginning
    of each phase containing the rules for that phase, along with an
    FAQ if deemed fit by the Elections Committee. Elections will
    consist of 2 phases:

    4.  **Application Phase -** This phase lasts 2 full days and
        consists of applicants using forms to apply for candidacy.
        Candidates are encouraged to not openly campaign in the
        discord before the voting phase, but are encouraged to prepare
        their speech blocks ahead of time.

        9.  **(Optional) Endorsements -** If the elections committee
            deems it necessary, they may also require endorsements,
            which are anonymous endorsements of candidates by
            organization members (also done by form). In the event
            endorsements are required, a candidate will only appear on
            the final voting ballot if they come close to or reach the
            required number of endorsements. This prevents a flood of
            joke candidates on the ballot. Members may endorse 2
            candidates per position. As they apply, a list of
            candidates should be posted and updated under the election
            announcement. Numbers of endorsements will not be made
            public, but the number of a candidate’s own current
            endorsements will be privately given to them upon request
            from an Elections Committee member.

            1.  **President -** Any candidate running for President
                must reach or come close to 15 endorsements to be on
                the final ballot.

            2.  **Vice President** - Any candidate running for Vice
                President must reach or come close to 10 endorsements
                to be on the final ballot.

            3.  **Treasurer** - Any candidate running for Treasurer
                must reach or come close to 10 endorsements to be on
                the final ballot.

            4.  **Secretary** - Any candidate running for Secretary
                must reach or come close to 10 endorsements to be on
                the final ballot.

            5.  **Community Director** - Any candidate running for
                Community Director must reach or come close to 10
                endorsements to be on the final ballot.

    5.  **Voting Phase -** After candidacy applications (and possibly
        endorsements) close, voting begins. Voting lasts for 2 full
        days, and members vote using the forms, which are counted at
        the end of the election by the Election Committee. After the
        election is over, the results are announced to the whole
        organization with detailed statistics. Executive Board
        elections follow an Alternative Voting (AV) system, where
        voters rate their choices in order and that order is factored
        into their vote (typically by giving each candidate votes
        based on their ratings, ex. first choice is n, second choice
        is n-1, etc.). This prevents multi round voting that decreases
        voter turnout and increases polarization. However, if there
        are only 2 or fewer candidates per position, a simple majority
        vote will be administered, because it is easier for everyone.

    6.  **Discord Rules** - At the end of the application phase, 2
        extra Discord channels should be set up: one
        (\#election\_speeches) having posting permissions set only for
        those with the “EBoard Candidate” role, and the other
        (\#elections) being the only chat in which “political”
        discourse is not discouraged. The “EBoard Candidate” role
        should be given to all candidates that apply, and should be
        removed if they do not meet the endorsement requirements in
        time or if they withdraw. Candidates are each limited to 1
        post in the \#election\_speeches channel, this post will
        usually be their “vote for me” speech block. All other
        elections discourse should take place in the \#elections
        channel. Candidates are encouraged to change their nicknames
        to display both their real first and last name as well as
        their usual username.

4.  **Manager/Team Elections -** Managers are elected by their teams
    every year after tryouts. This is informal and can take various
    forms, from the current Manager selecting candidates for team
    approval to team members applying and being voted on by the rest
    of the team. Teams may decide to ask the Executive Board for help
    with these elections if they need it.

**Appointments -** Appointed officials, such as Chairs, are selected by
the Executive Board. One or more members of the Board may bring forth
candidates for the position, and these candidates are voted in by a
simple majority Executive Board vote
