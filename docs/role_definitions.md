task has been completed. Members of a committee may be any role within
the organization and all have equal say, unless the Chair or Executive
Board member that created the committee needs to change the direction of
the committee.

**Team Roles**

Here we lay out a framework for team-based roles. These roles are
guidelines and are intended as a bare minimum. Teams may decide on a
case-by-case basis to omit, add, or combine roles, or add extra
responsibilities to those listed here, in the interest of making their
team structure ideal for their situation. In any case, the team's
Manager has the authority to decide any role-based rulings for their
team.

***Manager***: This role is an elected
position by all members of the affiliated game, including mentor,
Captain, and players. The Manager is responsible for helping the team
communicate with the Executive Board, setting up tournaments, and
communication with tournament officials. This includes proposing budgets
for the team, as well as requesting funds. Additionally, the Manager is
responsible for running team tryouts and maintaining the team roster.
The Manager has the power to remove players for Code of Conduct
violations, as well as any team transfers that might be necessary
throughout the season. For transfers that are not Code of Conduct
related, the Manager should speak with the Captain or a team
representative to ensure the team is amenable to the change. The Manager
is also responsible for resolving player conflicts and serving as a
mediator in those instances. Managers may not hold another team role,
unless absolutely necessary. Managers have a voice in all Executive
Board meetings, but no vote.

***Captain**:* This role is chosen by the
players on the team by the end of the first month after tryouts. If the
team feels that the Captain role needs to be switched, the team may
choose a new Captain, after advising their Manager. The Captain is the
spokesperson for the team and helps to convey the team’s thoughts to the
mentor and the Manager. The Captain is responsible for handling team
dynamics, but can receive assistance from the Manager if serious
problems arise. They can also take on additional roles with regards to
analysis and team dynamics as the team sees fit. If the team feels that
there is no need for a Captain, the team will convey this to their
Manager.

***Mentor/Coach/Analyst**:* This role is
an elected position by all members of the affiliated game, including
Manager, Captain, and players. Each team can decide what this role is
called, based on the role this person fills. If a team deems it
necessary, multiple people can fill this role. The Mentor is responsible
for helping the team to analyze previous games, giving advice about
gameplay, and helping the team to try new strategies. The mentor is not
responsible for intra-team dynamics or forcing the team to try their
ideas or practice. They are an analyst and supporter of the team that
the players and Captain are encouraged to utilize. Each team will decide
if the Mentor is a player, substitute player, or non player. If the team
feels that there is no need for a Mentor, the team will convey this to
their Manager.

***Player**:* This role is that of a
person who has been made an official team member after tryouts. This
role includes substitute players.
