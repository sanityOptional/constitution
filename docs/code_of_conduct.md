# **Code of Conduct**

We want RIT to win. To achieve this, we focus on developing both our
players and our teams into being the best they can be. Social disruption
through a violation of our code of conduct can hinder our progress
towards this goal. Therefore, any player causing disruption on our
teams, will be handled via disciplinary action.

1.  **Punishments -** In order to ensure that players learn their
    lesson after breaking the code of conduct, punishments will be
    handed out to players who are found to be at fault. Punishments
    vary, and who administers them depends on the situation. The
    relevant group cannot rule a decision on an infraction, argument,
    or event they are a part of. The primary categories of arbiters
    are as follows:

    1.  **Relevant Groups**
    
        1.  **Discord Bots** - Specific behaviors in chat, such as
            spam or banned words, will be automatically deleted by
            moderation bots. All Managers, Moderators, and Executive
            Board members will have access to logs detailing offenses
            handled by bots so that additional action can be taken if
            needed
            
        2.  **Moderators** - If the issue is related to behavior
            within the greater community (Discord, Reddit, Twitch,
            anything outside of singular team business, etc.),
            Moderators will be the primary arbiters.
            
        3.  **Managers** - If a player is found to be disruptive among
            their team and their team only, then their team’s Manager
            will handle the situation.
            
        4.  **Executive Board** **-** If any behavior escalates past
            minor offenses, or the event involves one of the above
            listed relevant groups, then the Executive Board will have
            to step in and take action (alongside the aforementioned
            groups if they were not involved with the disruption).
            Additionally, if the transgression is a serious matter of
            verbal abuse/harassment, delinquency, or integrity, it
            will be immediately escalated to the Executive board and
            Faculty Advisor.
            
    2.  **Punishment Severity** - Players who are repeatedly punished
        but have been found to not stop their inexcusable behavior
        will have their membership in the organization either
        suspended or terminated at the Executive Board’s discretion.
        In any event, a person will be notified of the reason for
        their punishment as well as the detail of the punishment
        itself. The punishing group is responsible for communicating
        this. Common punishments that come before removal from the
        organization may include:
        
        1.  In the case of Discord or social media, post deletion.
        
        2.  Verbal and/or written warnings
        
        3.  Mandatory disciplinary meeting with a player’s Manager
            and/or Captain
        
        4.  Temporary suspension from a team’s roster
        
        5.  Permanent ban from a team’s roster/organization

2.  **Reporting -** In the event that players notice another player
    violating these rules, the player in violation should be reported
    to a team Manager or the Executive Board. All reports and
    reporters’ names will be kept confidential within the groups
    involved with the arbitration.

    3.  **Retaliation** - If someone reports a player, or is prevented
        from reporting a player, anyone who attempts or carries out
        any form of retaliation, or prevention against the report,
        against the reporter(s) will be immediately punished,
        regardless of the severity of the original infraction.

3.  **Interaction -** The following rules are in effect for any
    interaction involved with RIT Esports. This includes the Discord,
    Reddit, Twitch, etc. This also includes official practices and
    tournaments, as well as other events scheduled in an official
    capacity of the organization.

    4.  **Verbal abuse** - All interactions, regardless of whether or
        not they are conducted through text or voice communications,
        and regardless of whether the interactions are being broadcast
        to the public, with the intention to emotionally harm the
        intended receptor, are not tolerated in any form, regardless
        of whether discrimination matches the receptor or not:
        
        1. Discrimination in regard to race or religion
        
        2. Discrimination in regard to gender or sexual orientation
        
        3. Discrimination in regard to physical characteristics
        
        4. Discrimination in regard to the disabled
        
        5. Discrimination in regard to political or other similar
            beliefs

    5.  **Physical abuse** - Any physical interaction without consent
        of the receptor will not be tolerated in any form, including
        the following:
        1. Physical interactions conducted without consent of the
            receptor
        2. Any threats of physical abuse/harm

    6.  **Decency** - While not directly verbal abuse, some topics can
        be found to reflect poorly on RIT Esports and RIT when joked
        about or made light of. Players found violating this rule may
        be warned or disciplined according to the gravity of the
        infraction. Players should not openly joke about:
        
        1. Discrimination
        
        2. Suicide
        
        3. Genocide
        
        4. Terrorism or Criminal Acts (examples are listed under the
            next heading)

    7.  **Delinquency** - As RIT Esports members, players are expected
        to be upstanding human beings. As such, any discussion of
        criminal acts undertaken or planned to be undertaken by anyone
        will be met with a single warning. After this warning, any
        further discussion by warned members will result in
        disciplinary action. If a member is found to have participated
        in any of these acts, their warning may be waived and
        disciplinary action may be taken immediately. This includes
        but is not limited to:

        1. Underage Drinking, or drinking in non-designated places on
            campus

        2. Driving Under the Influence

        3. Use of Illegal Drugs

        4. Prescription or OTC Drug Abuse

        5. Rape or Sexual Harassment

        6. Assault or Battery

        7. Piracy, digital or otherwise

        8. Theft or Destruction of Property

    8.  **Sportsmanship** - All players are expected to abide by the
        core principles of sportsmanship when interacting with other
        teams in game. This means players should not:
        
        1. Engage in ‘toxic’ behavior that involves any form of
            verbal abuse.
        
        2. Always be polite and courteous to opposing schools, as
            well as opponents in general.
        
        3. Be humble and gracious. Being a part of the organization
            is a privilege, not a right. Whenever possible, criticism
            should be constructive. Similarly, constructive criticism
            from others should be accepted respectfully.
        
        4. Respect the other members of the organization and their
            roles. This includes Managers, Mentors, Captains, Players,
            the Executive Board, Chairs, Community Roles, and
            Moderators. This includes ceasing offensive of aggressive
            behavior when asked to stop.

    9.  **Public Chats** - While all of the above rules are not
        tolerated anywhere, there are some things that make our
        Discord more presentable in the public chat channels. The
        public chat channels are subject to heavier moderation than
        internal organization chat channels.
        
        1. Excessive Profanity
        
        2. Excessive Deprecation

4.  **Integrity -** One of the core pillars we stand on. All members
    of the organization are expected to abide by the following rules
    when participating in official tryouts, practices, and
    tournaments:

    1. **Match Fixing** - Match fixing is not tolerated under any
        form. All players are expected to give their all when
        competing in any match, and players who are found to not
        follow this rule will be punished, by both RIT and the
        tournament host(s) themselves.

    2. **Cheating** - Players modifying gamefiles or coordinating
        with non-players during any match, official game or scrim,
        will be immediately investigated and if the action was
        confirmed, all responsible will be immediately dismissed from
        the organization.

    3. **Performance Enhancers** - Any use of *non-prescribed* mental
        stimulants, such as Adderall, is strictly prohibited.

5.  **Scholarship**

    1. **Academic Standing** - All players are expected to be on good
        academic standing. Any player that falls below this quota will
        be suspended until their standing improves. Additionally, if
        players are losing their full-time student status, be it
        graduating, dropping out, taking leave of absence, or
        transferring, they should let their team Manager
            know.

6.  **Attendance -** As part of a team, it is crucial that players be
    at practices and events on time and ready to perform.

    1. **Absence** - Players who are absent or missing for the
        majority of a practice without notifying the team beforehand
        will get 3 warnings before disciplinary actions are taken. For
        major events, such as tournament matches, an unannounced
        absence will count as 2 warnings. Players who are consistently
        absent, even with prior notification, may also be punished
        similarly after more warnings. Punishments are up to the
        discretion of each team’s Manager and Captains. Absence counts
        will reset at the end of a semester.

    2. **Tardiness** - Players who are tardy (more than 5 minutes for
        practices) to practices or events without notifying the team
        beforehand will get 5 warnings before disciplinary actions are
        taken. For major events, such as tournaments, an unannounced
        tardiness will count as 2 warnings. Players who are
        consistently late, even with prior notification, may also be
        punished similarly after more warnings. Punishments are up to
        the discretion of each team’s Manager and captains. Tardy
        counts will reset at the end of a semester.

7.  **Arbitration -** Items not specifically covered in this handbook,
    arguments, punishment appeals, or disputes over the rules
    themselves, are subject to final ruling by the player’s team
    Manager, Moderators, and/or the Executive Board, depending on the
    jurisdiction of the item as listed under **Punishments**, and
    whether any of those parties were involved in the event in
    question. A vote will be held with an odd number (minimum of five)
    of individuals from the relevant groups to decide the punishment
    required. Results will be detailed in an official log of
    arbitration rulings called the Precedent Log. An up to date copy
    of the Precedent Log will be available for viewing in every place
    this handbook is found and will be used to inform decisions on
    similar cases in the future. These entries will be general, and
    will regard the rules in question, and will not involve the names
    or similar identifying information of any of the parties involved.
